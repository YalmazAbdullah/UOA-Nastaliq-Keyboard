            <p>In this project, we are evaluating three different Urdu text entry tools. You will be asked to type a series of sentences using each tool, followed by a short questionnaire at the end of the session. The entire process is expected to take no more than XX minutes. <b>We request that you complete this in one sitting and one attempt.</b> Before we begin, we would like you to read the following consent form carefully.
            </p>
